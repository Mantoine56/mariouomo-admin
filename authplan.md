- Phase 3: 100% complete
- Phase 4: 90% complete
- Phase 5: 0% complete
- Phase 6: 0% complete
- Phase 7: 50% complete
- Phase 8: 0% complete

## Current Focus
- Completing Phase 4 with ForgotPassword implementation
- Beginning work on email verification
- Planning Redux integration for Phase 5

## Recent Updates
- Completed Supabase integration for RegisterForm
- Added comprehensive test suite for RegisterForm
- Updated validation and error handling
- Improved user feedback during registration process

## Implementation Strategy: Hybrid Approach

We've chosen the hybrid approach for the following reasons:

1. **UI Components**
   - Keep version 1 of template auth UI components
   - Remove versions 2 and 3 to maintain consistency
   - Maintain existing design system integration

2. **Auth Logic**
   - Replace template auth with Supabase
   - Utilize Supabase's session management
   - Implement secure authentication flows

3. **State Management**
   - Keep existing Redux structure
   - Add Supabase-specific auth slice
   - Maintain UI state consistency

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 2: Template Selection and Cleanup
2. Move to Phase 4: Authentication Components Integration
3. Proceed with Phase 5: State Management Integration

Each phase will be implemented incrementally, with testing at each step to ensure functionality.

## Files to Create/Modify

### 1. Authentication Utilities
```typescript
// lib/supabase/client.ts
import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'

export const createClient = () => createBrowserClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
)
```

### 2. Middleware
```typescript
// middleware.ts
import { createMiddlewareClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function middleware(req) {
  const res = NextResponse.next()
  const supabase = createMiddlewareClient({ req, res })
  const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession()

  if (!session && req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/auth/login', req.url))
  }

  return res
}
```

### 3. Auth Components
```typescript
// components/auth/LoginForm.tsx
// components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx
// components/auth/ResetPassword.tsx
// components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx
```

## Audit Existing Auth-Related Code
1. Check /app/(auth) directory contents
2. Review Redux store for auth state
3. Look for existing middleware implementations

## Document Current Auth Flow
1. Login/logout process
2. Protected route mechanism
3. Session management

## Make Integration Decisions
1. Whether to replace or integrate with existing auth
2. How to handle state management conflicts
3. Migration strategy for existing users (if any)

## Next Steps

Before proceeding with the current plan, I recommend:

1. **Audit Request**
```markdown
Please provide:
- Contents of /app/(auth)/* directory
- Any existing auth-related Redux code
- Current middleware implementation
- Existing auth components
```

2. **Decision Points**
```markdown
Need to decide:
1. Keep or replace template auth system?
2. How to handle state management integration?
3. Migration strategy for existing data?
4. Component integration approach?
```

The current Supabase implementation plan is solid in isolation, but we need to understand the existing authentication system before proceeding. This will help avoid conflicts and ensure a smooth integration or replacement strategy.

Would you be able to share the contents of the `/app/(auth)` directory and any existing auth-related code? This would help us make more specific recommendations and possibly modify the implementation plan accordingly.

## Template Integration:
- How Supabase auth will coexist/replace template auth
- State management strategy (Redux + Supabase)
- Component integration/replacement strategy

## Migration Strategy:
- How to handle existing users (if any)
- Transition period management
- Data preservation plan 

## Required Code Audit
Before proceeding with any implementation, we need to examine:

1. **Template Auth Implementation**
   - /app/(auth)/* directory contents
   - Current auth flow and components
   - Existing middleware
   - Protected route implementation

2. **State Management**
   - Redux store structure
   - Auth-related reducers and actions
   - Existing auth hooks or utilities

3. **Template Dependencies**
   - Current auth-related packages
   - Potential conflicts with Supabase
   - Required template-specific features

## Decision Checklist
- [ ] Document current template auth implementation
- [ ] Identify if template uses JWT or session-based auth
- [ ] Map out existing protected route logic
- [ ] Review template's auth state management
- [ ] Assess impact of replacing/modifying template auth
- [ ] Evaluate template's auth component architecture

## Questions for Template Review
1. Does the template use:
   - Custom auth implementation?
   - Third-party auth provider?
   - Built-in auth components?
2. How are protected routes currently handled?
3. What auth state management exists?
4. Are there template-specific auth features we need to maintain?

## Implementation Options
1. **Full Template Auth**
   - Keep template's auth system
   - Integrate Supabase as data layer only
   
2. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Keep template's UI components
   - Replace auth logic with Supabase
   - Maintain template's state management pattern

3. **Full Supabase Implementation**
   - Replace template auth entirely
   - Rebuild auth UI with Supabase
   - New state management integration

Please provide access to the template's auth-related code to help make these decisions.
